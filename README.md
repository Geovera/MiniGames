# MiniGames

## Description
Quickly thrown together minigames to play online with friends.

Some pals wanted to play parchis so I decided to start this.

* Currently has Anime themed parchis with abilities! *

May add more minigames if we ever get that itch again

## Setup

Just pull the repo and start unity using the folder. Nothing fancy required.

## 1. Anime Parchis

This is a minigame parchis following regular rules. But to make it more interesting, I decided to add characters and abilities based on anime characters that my friends like.
Each ability description is available in the character selection screen.

Steps to play Anime parchis:

1. Build Main Menu and Parchis Scenes.
2. Distrubute build among your friends
3. You can choose between p2p or dedicated game server for online multiplayer.
4. Will probably need to port forward. (Default is port 7777 unless changed in the U NET Transport)
5. Players will join by ip of the host.
6. Players choose characters and play parchis. (Rules for parchis https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/parchis-rules-instructions-guide.htm)
